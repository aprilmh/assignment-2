I took this class so I could use the skills I learn in this class in my future career. 
While I know it is going to be hard I think it is good to know how to do. 
I also think it is good to understand how computers work, since we use them all the time. 

I hope to learn how to create a nice looking website, I hope to have a basic understanding of coding and a better understanding of the internet.
